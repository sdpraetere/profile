      <h2>CEO @ Lisbon WorkHub</h2>

      <p>
        After 4 years in healthcare management, I took a leap and became an entrepreneur, launching a cowork, the Lisbon WorkHub, a magazine for entrepreneurs, the StartUp Magazine and a platform for booking medical consultations, MedClick.

              <h3>Blink by Malcolm Gladwell</h3>
              <p>Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren’t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error?</p>

              <h3>Art of Innovation by Tom Kelley</h3>
              <p>There isn't a business in America that doesn't want to be more creative in its thinking, products, and processes. At many companies, being first with a concept and first to market are critical just to survive. In The Art of Innovation, Tom Kelley, general manager of the Silicon Valley based design firm IDEO, takes readers behind the scenes of this wildly imaginative and energized company to reveal the strategies and secrets it uses to turn out hit after hit.</p>

              <h3>Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath</h3>
              <p>Made to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It’s a fast-paced tour of idea success stories (and failures)—the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher’s simulation that actually prevented prejudice . Provocative, eye-opening, and funny, Made to Stick shows us the principles of successful ideas at work—and how we can apply these rules to making our own messages “stick.”</p>
